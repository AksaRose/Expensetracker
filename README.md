## How it Works ?
The Expense Tracker application is built using Streamlit, a powerful and easy-to-use Python framework for building web applications. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how the project works:

1. **User Input**: Users can input their expense details, including description, amount, category, and date.
2. **Data Storage**: Expenses are temporarily stored in the session state during the user's session. For persistence, an SQLite database can be integrated.
3. **Visualization**: The app provides a summary of total expenses and displays expenses by category in a bar chart.
4. **Feedback**: Users receive immediate feedback upon adding an expense, and the app updates the visualization dynamically.

## Libraries used
- **Streamlit - Version 1.10.0**: For creating the web application.
